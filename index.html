<h2>The Artist Formerly Known As Ye Olde SteamOSe</h2>

  <p>SteamOS is now shipping, in beta form at least, and it's all cool and stuff.</p>

  <p>Valve have now integrated most of the improvements from Ye Olde SteamOSe, such as BIOS and DVD support, into their installer. You can download it from <a href="http://repo.steampowered.com/download/SteamOSDVD.iso">here</a>.</p>

  <p>Stephenson's Rocket replaces the Ye Olde SteamOSe project by building back on Valve's installer with bug fixes and improvements - especially hardware support.</p>

  <p>This kind of collaborative development demonstrates the power of Open Source - and remember, you can contribute to Stephenson's Rocket too! Click "View on GitHub" at the top of the screen to get started, and watch the development tutorial video linked below!</p>

<h2>Improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>SteamOS monopolizes drives. Stephenson's Rocket can resize NTFS partitions.</li>
    <li>SteamOS only supports basic partitions. Stephenson's Rocket supports LVM and RAID.</li>
    <li>SteamOS requires a Radeon 5000 or newer for ATI users. Stephenson's Rocket will use the Open Source driver instead on older cards.</li>
    <li>SteamOS requires a Geforce 400 or newer for NVIDIA users. Stephenson's Rocket will use the legacy 340 series driver instead on older cards.</li>
    <li>SteamOS is only updated when Valve have time. Stephenson's Rocket comes with the tools to update it with the latest stuff yourself!</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a href="http://download.stephensonsrocket.horse/release/StephensonsRocket2.49plus1.iso.torrent">Torrent</a></h3>

  <p>To get started, download the torrent above.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, clone this repo, and run gen.sh.</p>

  <h4>Installing from a DVD</h4>

    <p>Just burn the ISO to a blank DVD from your favourite tool, and boot it.</p>

  <h4>Installing from USB (Mac)</h4>

    <p>Open a Terminal window from the Utilities section of Applications.</p>

    <p>Type &quot;diskutil list&quot; to get a list of devices - one of them will be your USB stick (e.g. /dev/disk2). Follow the Linux instructions below, with this /dev/rdiskX entry instead of /dev/sdX (please note the added "r"!)</p>

  <h4>Installing from USB (Linux)</h4>

    <p>As root (e.g. use &quot;sudo&quot;) run &quot;dd bs=1M if=/path/to/rocket.iso of=/dev/sdX&quot; - sdX should be the USB stick device (check &quot;dmesg&quot; immediately after plugging it in, you should see the device. Be sure to use sdX, not sdX1 or sdX2. Then boot into the stick.</p>

  <h4>Installing from USB (Windows)</h4>

    <p>Download <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/">Win32 Disk Imager</a> and use it to copy the .iso to your USB stick (1GB minimum size).</p>

  <h4>Once the installer is up...</h4>

    <p>Pick the "Automatic Install" option to wipe the first hard disk in your system and install SteamOS to it.</p>

    <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/5Cy8RUKMXyI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

    <p>For more sophisticated booting - e.g. dual-boot or custom partition sizes - select the "Expert" option. Use of this mode is documented in the support video above.</p>

    <p>Beyond that, just follow Valve's instructions from <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/steamos/buildyourown">their site</a> - Stephenson's Rocket should behave <i>exactly</i> like the real SteamOS, except it works on more systems</p>

<h2>Known issues</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>3D support is broken in Big Picture Mode itself and in 32-bit games in VirtualBox. This is a flaw in the VirtualBox guest drivers.</li>
  </ul>
